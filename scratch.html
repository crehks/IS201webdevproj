            <h2>Welcome To The World of F1</h2>
            <p>
                Formula 1 is regarded as the pinnacle of motorsport engineering and driver skill. 
                From the creation and implimentation of hybrid engines to the precise pit stops, every race is 
                a, "spectacle of speed, strategy, and determination." I've loved F1 
                for years, and I love everything about the sport. The drivers, the tracks, the strategy,
                and most importantly, the technology that makes it all possible.

                <h3>Favorite Track: Monaco Grand Prix</h3>
                <p>
                    Monaco is the most iconic and prestigious race on the F1 calendar. The narrow 
                    streets of Monte Carlo, the beautiful setting, and the incredible challenge it 
                    presents to drivers make it my favorite. There's very little room for error, and overtaking 
                    is nearly impossible, which means their qualifying position is crucial. Watching drivers 
                    navigate through the Casino Square and the famous tunnel at 180 mph is absolutely insane!
                    Las Vegas is a close second with its use of the famous strip and newly built Sphere
                </p>

            <div class="favorite-item">
                <h3>Favorite Team</h3>
                <p>
                    McLaren is easily my favorite F1 team. With a rich history of success, incredible Innovation
                    in car engineering, and legendary drivers like Ayrton Senna and Lewis Hamilton having raced for them,
                    McLaren truly embodies the spirit of F1. Their current roster with young talents like Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri
                    puts them in a position for long-term success. I can't wait to see what they achieve with the new 2026 regulations!
                </p>

            <div class="favorite-item">
                <h3>Favorite Driver</h3>
                <p>
                    Although Lewis Hamilton is an all-time great and Oscar Piastri is a promising talent, my favorite driver has to be Max Verstappen.
                    His agressive driving style, constant desire to win, and his personality both on and off the track make him an incredible driver to watch.
                    His dominating performance in 2023 and 2024 alongside his persistence through a challenging team and car this year show his true skill and determination.
                    We are truly witnessing a generational talent in Verstappen and he will be an F1 legend long before his career is over.
